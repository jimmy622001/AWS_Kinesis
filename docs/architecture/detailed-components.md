# Detailed Architecture Components

## Core Infrastructure Layer

- **Multi-AZ VPC** (10.0.0.0/16) with public/private subnets
- **Internet Gateway** for public internet access
- **NAT Gateways** (2x) for private subnet outbound connectivity
- **Transit Gateway** as central connectivity hub
- **VPC Endpoints** for S3 and DynamoDB private access

## Ultra-Low Latency Trading Layer

- **Placement Groups** with clustered C5n instances
- **Enhanced Networking** (SR-IOV, ENA) for sub-millisecond latency
- **Dedicated Tenancy** EC2 instances for compliance isolation
- **IPSec VPN** tunnels for secure hybrid connectivity
- **Direct Connect** ready infrastructure for exchange feeds

## Event-Driven Trading Systems

- **Kinesis Data Streams** (10 shards) handling 10,000+ messages/second
- **Kinesis Firehose** streaming compressed data to S3
- **EventBridge** custom bus for order routing and execution
- **SQS Queues** with zero-delay, 14-day retention for compliance
- **SNS Topics** for real-time notifications and alerts
- **Dead Letter Queues** for failed trade recovery

## Container Orchestration & Serverless

- **ECS Fargate** clusters running trading engines
- **Application Load Balancer** with health checks and auto-scaling
- **Lambda Functions** with X-Ray tracing and VPC connectivity
- **API Gateway** for RESTful trading APIs
- **Auto Scaling Groups** responding to market volatility

## Data & Storage Layer

- **RDS Multi-AZ** for trade history and positions
- **DynamoDB** for real-time order books and market data
- **S3 Buckets** with versioning and encryption for compliance
- **EFS** for persistent monitoring data storage
- **EBS Snapshots** with automated lifecycle management

## Security & Compliance

- **AWS WAF** protecting against malicious trading requests
- **Security Groups** for trading engines, market data, compliance tiers
- **Network ACLs** providing multi-layer network security
- **KMS Customer-Managed Keys** for enhanced encryption
- **IAM Roles** with least-privilege access for different user types
- **VPC Flow Logs** for real-time network monitoring

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Prometheus** collecting sub-millisecond latency metrics
- **Grafana** dashboards showing P99 latency and trading performance
- **CloudWatch** with custom metrics and alarms (<1ms alerts)
- **AWS X-Ray** for distributed tracing of order execution
- **CloudTrail** for immutable audit trails

## CI/CD & Automation

- **CodePipeline** for automated infrastructure deployments
- **CodeBuild** for testing and validation
- **CodeCommit** for version-controlled infrastructure code
- **AWS Backup** with compliance retention policies

## Disaster Recovery

- **Cross-Region Replication** for critical trading data
- **Automated Failover** with <30 second RTO
- **Data Integrity Validation** with checksums
- **Point-in-Time Recovery** for trading engine state
