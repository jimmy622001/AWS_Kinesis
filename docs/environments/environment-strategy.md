# Environment Strategy for AWS Kinesis Infrastructure

This document outlines our approach to managing multiple environments (development and production) for the AWS Kinesis infrastructure.

## Environment Principles

Our infrastructure follows these core principles for environment management:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Development and production environments are completely isolated
2. **Configuration as Code**: All environment differences are expressed through code
3. **Consistent Architecture**: Both environments use identical architecture with scaled resources
4. **Automated Provisioning**: Both environments are provisioned through CI/CD pipelines
5. **Cost Optimization**: Development environment uses reduced resources where appropriate

## Environment Differences

| Feature | Development | Production | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Kinesis Stream Shards | 2 | 10 | Reduced cost for dev, full capacity for prod |
| Retention Period | 24 hours | 7 days | Lower storage costs for dev, full compliance for prod |
| Instance Types | t3.medium | m5.large | Cost savings for dev, performance for prod |
| Alerting Thresholds | 80% CPU | 70% CPU | Earlier warnings in production |
| Auto-scaling | Minimal | Aggressive | Cost control in dev, performance in prod |
| Backup Frequency | Daily | Hourly | Balance between protection and cost |
| Multi-AZ Deployment | Limited | Full | Higher availability in production |

## State Management

Each environment maintains its own Terraform state file:

- **Development**: Stored in `terraform-state-dev` S3 bucket
- **Production**: Stored in `terraform-state-prod` S3 bucket

This separation ensures that operations on one environment cannot affect the other.

## Deployment Workflow

### Development Workflow

1. Changes are made in the `dev` branch
2. Automated tests and security scans run
3. Terraform plan is generated and reviewed
4. Changes are automatically applied to development environment
5. Testing is performed in development

### Production Workflow

1. Pull request is created from `dev` to `main`
2. Code review is performed
3. After approval, PR is merged to `main`
4. Production deployment pipeline runs
5. Terraform plan is generated and reviewed
6. Manual approval is required
7. Changes are applied to production environment

## Security Considerations

- Both environments implement the same security controls
- Production has more restrictive access policies
- Secrets management uses environment-specific paths
- Security scanning thresholds are stricter for production

## Best Practices

1. Always test changes in development before deploying to production
2. Document all environment-specific configurations
3. Keep environment differences to a minimum
4. Review Terraform plans carefully before applying
5. Maintain separate monitoring dashboards for each environment

## Conclusion

This environment strategy enables us to develop and test safely while ensuring production stability and performance.
