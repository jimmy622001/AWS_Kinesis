# Multi-Region Disaster Recovery Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the multi-region disaster recovery (DR) strategy for the AWS Trading Platform POC. The approach follows a "Pilot Light" pattern, where a minimal version of the environment is always running in the DR region and can be rapidly scaled up in the event of a disaster.

## Architecture

### Primary Components

1. **Primary Region**: Full production environment with all services running
2. **DR Region**: Minimal "pilot light" infrastructure that can be scaled up when needed
3. **Cross-Region Replication**: Automated data replication between regions
4. **Route 53 DNS Failover**: Automated and manual failover capabilities

## Pilot Light Approach

The pilot light approach maintains a minimal infrastructure in the DR region that includes:

- VPC and networking components
- Small-scale EKS cluster with minimal nodes
- RDS read replica
- S3 cross-region replication
- DynamoDB global tables
- CloudWatch monitoring and alarms

This approach offers a balance between cost and recovery time objectives (RTO).

## Failover Mechanisms

### Automated Failover

1. **Health Checks**: Route 53 health checks monitor the primary region's endpoints
2. **CloudWatch Alarms**: Trigger when the primary region becomes unhealthy
3. **SNS Notifications**: Alert operations team and trigger automated responses
4. **Lambda Function**: Performs automated failover steps:
   - Scale up DR EKS nodes
   - Update Route 53 DNS to point to DR region
   - Promote RDS read replica to primary
   - Notify operations team

### Manual Failover

In addition to automated failover, manual procedures are documented for operations team to:

1. Scale up DR infrastructure
2. Verify application health in DR region
3. Manually update DNS if needed
4. Monitor failover success

## Data Replication Strategy

| Data Type | Replication Method | RPO |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| RDS Database | RDS cross-region read replica | ~1 minute |
| S3 Objects | S3 Cross-Region Replication | ~15 minutes |
| Session Data | DynamoDB Global Tables | Seconds |
| Container Images | ECR Cross-Region Replication | ~15 minutes |
| Application State | Stateless design, backed by replicated data stores | N/A |

## Recovery Time and Point Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 15-30 minutes
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: ~15 minutes (limited by S3 replication lag)

## Testing and Validation

The DR strategy should be tested quarterly with the following approach:

1. **Scheduled DR Drills**: Simulate primary region failure
2. **Backup Validation Tests**: Ensure backups can be properly restored
3. **Failover Testing**: Validate both automated and manual failover procedures
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure DR region can handle production load

## Failback Procedure

After the primary region is restored, a controlled failback should be performed:

1. Ensure data replication from DR to primary region is established
2. Validate application in primary region
3. Gradually shift traffic back to primary region
4. Scale down DR region back to pilot light state

## Cost Considerations

The pilot light approach balances cost and recovery speed by:

- Maintaining minimal compute resources in DR region
- Using smaller instance sizes when possible
- Leveraging AWS reserved instances for always-on components
- Auto-scaling for on-demand resources during failover

## Responsibility Matrix

| Task | Owner | Frequency |
|------|-------|-----------|
| DR Testing | DevOps Team | Quarterly |
| Failover Procedure Review | Architecture Team | Biannually |
| Alert Monitoring | Operations | 24/7 |
| DR Documentation Update | DevOps Team | Quarterly |

## Scaling Considerations

The DR region infrastructure is designed to quickly scale to handle production load:

1. EKS node groups with auto-scaling enabled
2. RDS instance can be upgraded to a larger size if needed
3. NAT Gateway can handle increased egress traffic

## Future Enhancements

1. Implement active-active architecture for zero RTO
2. Add Aurora Global Database for improved database replication
3. Implement AWS Global Accelerator for improved failover routing
4. Consider AWS Transit Gateway inter-region peering for direct network connectivity
5. Implement cross-region CI/CD pipelines for simultaneous deployments
