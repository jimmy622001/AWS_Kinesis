# AWS Trading Platform - Architecture

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Networking & Security**
- Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnets
- Enhanced networking (SR-IOV, ENA) for low latency
- VPC endpoints for private connectivity
- Transit Gateway and IPSec VPN
- AWS WAF, Security Groups, KMS encryption
- AWS Secrets Manager for credential management

**Event Processing**
- Kinesis Data Streams (10 shards, 10K+ msg/sec)
- EventBridge for order routing
- SQS/SNS with dead letter queues
- Lambda functions with X-Ray tracing

**Container Orchestration**
- EKS cluster with managed node groups and auto-scaling
- Cluster Autoscaler for automatic node scaling
- EKS addons (VPC CNI, CoreDNS, Kube-proxy)
- OIDC provider for service account integration

**Data & Storage**
- RDS Multi-AZ for high availability
- DynamoDB for real-time data
- S3 with versioning and encryption
- EFS for persistent storage

**Monitoring & CI/CD**
- Prometheus and Grafana dashboards
- CloudWatch with custom metrics
- CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeCommit
- AWS Backup with automated snapshots

## Disaster Recovery Architecture

The platform implements a cross-region disaster recovery strategy using a pilot light approach with automatic scaling:

### Components

1. **Primary Region**
   - Full production environment
   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Auto-scaling groups
   - Primary database

2. **DR Region**
   - Minimal infrastructure (1 t3.small node by default)
   - Automated scaling to match primary region during failover
   - Read replicas for databases
   - S3 cross-region replication

3. **Global Services**
   - Route 53 for DNS failover
   - DynamoDB Global Tables
   - S3 Cross-Region Replication

### Data Replication

- **RDS**: Asynchronous read replica in DR region
- **DynamoDB**: Global tables with multi-region replication
- **S3**: Cross-region replication for critical buckets
- **EKS**: Configuration as code with Terraform

### Security

- KMS encryption in transit and at rest
- IAM roles with least privilege
- VPC peering with encryption
- Security groups and network ACLs

## High Availability

- Multi-AZ deployment in primary region
- Automatic failover for RDS
- Load balanced services
- Stateless application design

## Performance

- Sub-millisecond networking with enhanced instances
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Caching layer with ElastiCache (optional)
- Optimized EKS cluster for container workloads

## Compliance & Security

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- VPC flow logs
- AWS Config rules for compliance
- Regular security scanning and patching
